## Visual Development

### Design Principles
- Comprehensive design checklist in `/context/design-principles.md`
- Brand style guide in `/context/style-guide.md`
- When making visual (front-end, UI/UX) changes, always refer to these files for guidance
- Use both coding AND visual intelligence - never design with blindfolds on
- Always take screenshots to see your work, then iterate based on visual feedback
- Embrace iterative refinement loops rather than single-shot implementations

### Quick Visual Check
IMMEDIATELY after implementing any front-end change:

1. **Identify what changed** - Review the modified components/pages and affected user flows
2. **Navigate to affected pages** - Use `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` to visit each changed view
3. **Multi-viewport screenshots** - Capture evidence at:
   - Desktop viewport (1440px)
   - Tablet viewport (768px)
   - Mobile viewport (375px)
   - iOS device emulation if mobile-critical
4. **Test interactions** - Actually use the interface:
   - Click buttons, links, and interactive elements
   - Fill out and submit forms with test data
   - Test hover states, animations, and navigation flows
   - Verify dropdowns, modals, and overlays function correctly
5. **Comprehensive error detection** - Run diagnostic checks:
   - `mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages` for JavaScript errors
   - `mcp__playwright__browser_network_logs` for network issues
   - Check for performance warnings and resource loading problems
   - Verify no broken images or missing assets
   - Monitor for memory leaks or slow loading resources
6. **Design compliance verification** - Compare against:
   - `/context/design-principles.md` and `/context/style-guide.md`
   - Any provided UI mockups or design specifications
   - Visual hierarchy, spacing, and typography consistency
   - Brand color application and contrast requirements
7. **Accessibility & performance audit** - Validate:
   - Color contrast ratios and WCAG compliance
   - Keyboard navigation through all interactive elements
   - Screen reader compatibility and semantic HTML structure
   - Touch target sizing for mobile devices (minimum 44px)
   - Performance metrics and load times
   - Proper heading hierarchy (H1-H6)

### User Flow Testing
When debugging reported issues or testing complex interactions:
- **Reproduce exact scenarios** - Navigate through the same steps users reported
- **Screenshot each stage** - Capture state at every step of multi-step processes
- **Monitor throughout journey** - Track console logs during full user flows
- **Test error states** - Verify graceful error handling and user feedback
- **Validate form submissions** - Test all form interactions with real data
- **Check state persistence** - Ensure data persists correctly across navigation

### Iterative Design Loop
Follow this continuous improvement cycle for complex UI work:
1. **Make Changes** - Implement code modifications
2. **Visual Feedback** - Take Playwright screenshots to see results
3. **Compare to Spec** - Validate against design requirements and style guides
4. **Identify Gaps** - Note discrepancies between actual and intended design
5. **Refine Implementation** - Make targeted improvements
6. **Repeat Loop** - Continue until design meets specifications

### Cross-Browser & Device Validation
For critical releases or major UI changes:
- Test primary browser compatibility (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- Verify consistent rendering across different browsers
- Check for browser-specific CSS issues or JavaScript errors
- Test on actual mobile devices when possible
- Validate progressive enhancement and graceful degradation

### Context Integration
Always leverage visual context for better outcomes:
- Include UI mockups, wireframes, or design references in prompts
- Attach screenshots of inspirational designs or competitor examples
- Provide style guides, color palettes, and typography specifications
- Reference low-fidelity sketches or hand-drawn concepts
- Use both textual requirements AND visual references to activate full AI capabilities

## Implementation Standards

### Error Handling
```javascript
// ALWAYS implement comprehensive error handling
try {
  const result = await riskyOperation();
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Operation failed', { error: error.message, stack: error.stack });
  return { success: false, error: 'Operation failed', code: 'OPERATION_ERROR' };
}
```

### Input Validation
```javascript
// ALWAYS validate and sanitize inputs
const validateInput = (data) => {
  if (!data || typeof data !== 'object') {
    throw new ValidationError('Invalid input data');
  }
  // Comprehensive validation logic
};
```

### Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// ALWAYS include performance tracking
const startTime = performance.now();
const result = await operation();
const duration = performance.now() - startTime;
logger.info('Operation completed', { duration, operation: 'operationName' });
```

## Playwright Usage Guidelines

### Required for ALL Frontend Work:
- Take multi-viewport screenshots after every UI change
- Test all interactive elements (buttons, forms, navigation)
- Verify responsive behavior across device sizes
- Check accessibility with keyboard navigation
- Monitor console logs for errors and warnings
- Test user flows end-to-end

### Example Playwright Workflow:
```javascript
// Navigate to page and test
await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/new-feature');
await page.screenshot({ path: 'feature-desktop.png' });
await page.setViewportSize({ width: 768, height: 1024 });
await page.screenshot({ path: 'feature-tablet.png' });
await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });
await page.screenshot({ path: 'feature-mobile.png' });

// Test interactions
await page.click('[data-testid="submit-button"]');
await page.fill('[data-testid="email-input"]', 'test@example.com');
```

## Code Review Integration

### Automated Security Scanning
- Check for exposed API keys, secrets, or credentials
- Scan for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities
- Verify authentication and authorization implementation
- Review dependency vulnerabilities
- Validate input sanitization and error handling

### Quality Assurance Checks
- Verify adherence to coding standards and patterns
- Check for performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage

## When to Continue Working vs. When to Stop

### Continue Working Until:
- Feature is completely implemented and functional
- All visual validation completed with Playwright
- Security audit passes without critical issues
- Performance meets or exceeds benchmarks
- Responsive design works across all target devices
- Accessibility compliance verified
- Comprehensive testing implemented
- Documentation updated and complete

### Only Stop When:
- All quality gates are met
- Implementation is production-ready
- No critical or major issues remain
- User requirements fully satisfied

Work autonomously and comprehensively. Make architectural decisions using industry best practices. Continue iterating until the implementation is robust, secure, performant, and production-ready. The power of this workflow comes from the feedback loop between code intelligence, visual intelligence, and iterative refinement that unlocks the full potential of AI-assisted development.
